If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you
characterize their audio aura?

Look like the danceability of the songs seems to be quite high on average, with
an average value of 0.71646. This suggests that the songs are generally suitable
for dancing. However, there's some variation, with some songs being less
danceable (46 are 0.258 < danceability < 0.71646) and others being highly
danceable (54 are 0.71646 < danceability < 0.964). The energy level of the songs
also appears to be relatively high on average, with an average energy value of
0.65906. This suggests that the songs are likely to be energetic and lively.
Similar to danceability, there's some variability in energy levels, with 47% of
songs having lower energy and 53% having higher energy. The valence of the songs,
which represents their positivity, is moderate, with an average value of
0.48444. This suggests a mix of both positive and less positive songs. It's
evenly split, with 51 of songs having lower valence and 49 having higher
valence.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very
representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would
you propose?

There others parameter to consider that seen to be more relevant than what was
said before. For example, the speechines look to be more representative, cause
the avarege value is 0.11557 and 65% of the song have lower speechines
indicating a preference for non-speech-heavy tracks (the songs are more melodic
and instrumental). Also, seen like the person has some favourites artists
(Drake, Ed Sheeran, Marshmello, Post Malone and XXXTENTACION) and he seek their
song (autoral and collab count to be 22 songs) and the other songs may be similar
to his favourits artits.
