Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, such as less than 10000 simulations, they start become less accurate.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It looks like the predictions stabilized after about 10,000, so I think 10,000 simulations is a good enough reward.
