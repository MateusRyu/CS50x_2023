                I have a bachelor's degree in marine science and technology and I am currently specializing in the area of technology, more specifically in the area of software development. I graduated from the prestigious Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP) in 2023 and have continued my studies independently.

                The course encourages scientific and technological study and analysis from a holistic and interdisciplinary perspective with a focus on the sea. Due to its interdisciplinary nature, I was able to develop the ability to understand and communicate technical information to lay people on a given subject. During my studies at UNIFESP, I took classes that introduced me to the analytical study and interpretation of data based on the scientific method, introduction to programming logic, data mining, database development and management, numerical modeling and static modeling, in addition, obviously, material directly related to marine science and technology. During the course I realized my vocation and passion for software development and decided to continue my studies in this area and enter this job market. During the Course Completion Work (TCC), alone and from scratch, I developed a web platform for phytoplankton management with georeferenced data, using PHP, SQL, JavaScript, Bootstrap (CSS), Twig (HTML). During the TCC, I was able to test my interest and ability to learn technologies that I had not worked on before, as well as my ability to communicate knowledge of ecology and IT in a simple and efficient way.

                I completed a basic course at Fundação Bradesco, an institution belonging to a renowned bank in Brazil, where I learned how to create a GUI application with Python in 2023. But I felt that I lacked a more solid foundation in computer science and how machines work.

                I'm currently taking Harvard's CS50x course to get a more solid foundation in my knowledge. The course teaches how machines work at a low level and how to solve software problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL and JavaScript, as well as CSS and HTML. The course has problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.
