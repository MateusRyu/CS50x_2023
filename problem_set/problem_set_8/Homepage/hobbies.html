                  <p>
                      My top 5 is made up "Monogatari series," "Yumekui Merry," "Clannad," "Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso," and "xxxHolic." Each of these shows holds a special place in my heart, reflecting a wide range of anime genres and storytelling styles.
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                        "Monogatari series" is at the top of my list due to its intricate narratives, clever dialogues, and visually striking abstract symbolism. All those elements contributes to develop the character and add more layers for each then. I find myself drawn to its unique approach to storytelling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Yumekui Merry" has a special appeal for me as well, thanks to its captivating blend of supernatural elements and action-packed sequences, but for me the most relevant thing is how they discuss and show the concept of "dream" and how dreams affect us. Exploring the complex dream world within the series is always an exciting adventure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Clannad" is a must-watch for anyone who, like me, appreciates emotionally charged character-driven narratives and heartwarming romance. It never fails to tug at my heartstrings. The first season show a high school days and some dilemas of some students. The second season focus in the protagonists as adults and how hard the life can strike.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso" is a favorite because of its profound exploration of music and emotions. I'm always moved by the way it delves into the complexities of its characters' lives.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lastly, "xxxHolic" rounds out my top 5 with its intriguing mix of supernatural elements, folklore, and mystery. The series' focus on the occult and Japanese mythology keeps me engaged and entertained.
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                <h2>Chess</h2>
                <div class="container d-flex flex-column flex-md-row justify-content-around align-items-center align-items-md-start flex-wrap">
                    <div id="chessContent">
                        <p>
                            Sure, I'd be happy to describe my style of play in chess. My favorite openings for White are the "Vienna Game," the "King's Gambit," and the "Van Geet Opening." These choices reflect my aggressive and tactical approach to the game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When playing as White, I prefer the Vienna Game because it allows me to seize the initiative early on and control the center of the board. The King's Gambit is another favorite of mine, where I'm not afraid to sacrifice a pawn to open up lines and launch swift attacks against my opponent's king. Lastly, I like the Van Geet Opening for its unpredictability, as it often leads to asymmetrical positions that take my opponents out of their comfort zones.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For my Black openings, I enjoy the "Latvian Gambit," the "Alekhine Defense," and the "Englund Gambit." These choices highlight my aggressive style when playing as Black. The Latvian Gambit involves sacrificing a pawn to gain rapid piece development and launch an early offensive. The Alekhine Defense is a hypermodern choice, where I let my opponent occupy the center with pawns and then aim to undermine it. And the Englund Gambit reflects my creative and unorthodox approach to the game, as I'm willing to sacrifice early to unsettle my opponent's position.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, I'm training in the "Benoni Defense." This opening is solid but aggressive, focusing on undermining White's center and creating imbalanced positions. It perfectly complements my style, as I enjoy taking risks, playing aggressively, and seeking tactical battles on the chessboard. I relish the challenge of unorthodox and dynamic openings, and I'm always looking for opportunities to surprise my opponents.
                        </p>
